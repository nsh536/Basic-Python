# This program checks if a number is even or odd                                            
# and prints the result accordingly.
# It uses the modulus operator to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
# If the remainder is 0, it is even; otherwise, it is odd.  
# The program prompts the user to input a number and then evaluates it.

# The result is printed to the console.
# Example usage:
# Enter a number: 4
# Output: Even
# Enter a number: 5
# Output: Odd
# This is a simple program to demonstrate the concept of even and odd numbers.
